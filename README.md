# grading_system
This program is a basic grading system that allows users to perform various operations. Here's an overview of what the program does:

It initializes the grading system with default values for maximum points per assignment, assignment names, and a student with the initial set of grades.
The program presents a menu with five options:
Option 1: Add a new student to the system.
Option 2: Record grades for a specific student and assignment.
Option 3: Print the grades of all students.
Option 4: Remove a student from the system.
Option 5: Exit the program.
Depending on the user's choice, the program executes the corresponding functionality:
Option 1 prompts the user to enter a student's name and adds the student to the system with initial grades set to zero.
Option 2 allows the user to select a student and assignment, then enter a grade for that assignment. The entered grade is recorded in the system.
Option 3 displays a table showing the grades of all students for each assignment.
Option 4 prompts the user to enter the name of a student to be removed from the system. If the student exists, they are removed; otherwise, an appropriate message is displayed.
Option 5 ends the program.
The menu is displayed after each operation until the user chooses to exit (option 5).
Overall, this program provides a simple interface to manage a grading system, including adding students, recording grades, printing grades, and removing students.
